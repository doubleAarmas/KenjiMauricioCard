			<p>This particular Snorkie was saved from a home that was overcrowded with
				more of his kind. The previous owners no longer able to care for him
				passed him along to our family. Little did we know he would be known throughout
				the block due to escaping if the front door is ever cracked open and
				always know to return home where he is fed and pampered. <strong>Neighbors with
				outdoor cats beware!</strong>
