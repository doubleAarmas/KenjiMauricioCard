                <p><em>Only found in the lands known as Westchester in Miami, Florida. 
                    This creature is fiercely loyal to his owners and has an
                    overwhelming need to follow his father directly behind him
                    wherever he may be heading.</em>

                    <li><span><strong>General Temperament</strong></span>: Extremely loyal towards

                <p>This particular Snorkie was saved from a home that was overcrowded with
                    more of his kind. The previous owners no longer able to care for him
                    passed him along to our family. Little did we know he would be known throughout
                    the block due to escaping if the front door is ever cracked open and
                    always know to return home where he is fed and pampered.
